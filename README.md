# Cement-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
### Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that uses the linear regression approach to estimate the compressive strength of cement. Cement's compressive strength is a crucial characteristic that determines whether it is appropriate for use in building. 

Construction firms and engineers may choose and use cement more wisely in their projects by determining compressive strength with more accuracy.

### Data
The dataset used in this project contains information on various properties of cement, including chemical composition, fineness and several other factors. 

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values.

### Algorithm
The research employs the supervised learning technique of linear regression, which predicts the connection between a dependent variable (compressive strength) and one or more independent factors (cement properties). 

Given that it is straightforward and simple to use, linear regression is regarded as an excellent option for predicting cement compressive strength.

### Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python 3.0
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

### Usage
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the command python main.py to train and evaluate the model
4. Or open the code in google colab & run all cells (press Ctrl + F9)

The model can be used to predict the compressive strength of new cement samples by passing their properties as input to the trained model

### Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean_absolute_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error and mean_squared_error on the testing dataset.

### Conclusion
The construction industry can greatly benefit from Cement Compressive Strength Prediction using Linear Regression. 

Construction firms and engineers can improve the quality and safety of their construction projects by choosing and using cement more intelligently by precisely forecasting compressive strength. 

A deeper knowledge of the underlying elements that impact compressive strength and the creation of new cement formulations can result from using the model to find patterns and correlations between cement characteristics and compressive strength.
