# Cement-Compressive-Strength-Prediction
Cement compressive strength refers to the ability of hardened cement to withstand loads that are applied to it. It is a measure of the cement's ability to resist failure under compression. The compressive strength of cement is typically measured in pounds per square inch (psi) or megapascals (MPa).

The compressive strength of cement is affected by several factors, including the type and proportion of the cement's constituent materials, the curing conditions, and the water-to-cement ratio. Generally, the compressive strength of cement increases as the water-to-cement ratio decreases and as the curing time increases.

The standard test method for determining the compressive strength of cement is ASTM C39, "Standard Test Method for Compressive Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens." This test involves measuring the compressive strength of cylindrical concrete specimens that are made with the cement being tested. The test is typically performed on specimens that are cured for 28 days.

Here we have used LinearRegression() from sklearn library of python to Predict the Concrete Compressive Strength(MPa, megapascals) of the cement using the Machine Learning
